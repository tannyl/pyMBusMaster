> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**: This project is in early development and is not yet functional.

Modern async Python library for M-Bus (Meter-Bus) communication.

## Planned Features

- **Async-first**: Will be built with asyncio for non-blocking serial communication
- **Python 3.13**: Using the latest Python features and type hints
- **Home Assistant**: Designed for easy integration with planned Home Assistant integration
- **Type Safe**: Comprehensive type hints with mypy checking
- **Well Tested**: Comprehensive test suite with pytest

## Installation

This package is not yet available on PyPI.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- pyserial-asyncio-fast

## License

MIT License - see [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.

## Goals

The goal is making a solid async M-Bus library for a Home Assistant integration, while still making it easy to use by anyone else.

I am also personally using this as an opportunity to learn and experiment with Claude Code.
